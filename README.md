# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Analysis



 key performance metrics from exercise recordings and user baseline data extraction:

- **Normalized Maximum Muscle Contraction:** For each repetition, the maximum pressure is normalized to the userâ€™s baseline pressure (from the users file) and then averaged.
- **Average Time Under Tension (TUT):** The average contraction duration per repetition.
- **Heart Rate Recovery:** Difference between the average heart rate during exercise and after exercise.

This analysis compares paired measurements for the same individuals under peppermint and control conditions using a suite of methods and visualizations that include:

- **Paired Data Visualization:** Paired line plots, density plots of differences, and Blandâ€“Altman plots.
- **Statistical Testing:** Paired tâ€“test, Wilcoxon signedâ€“rank test, effect size (Cohenâ€™s d), and bootstrap confidence intervals.
- **Multivariate Analysis:** MANOVA on the vector of differences across performance metrics.

This notebook is intended to provide a highâ€“level statistical assessment of RQ1.
